## What else about me?
I'm also **musician** and I love **design**!

I like psychology, plants 🌵, animals 🐾 , nice people of any race, color, height, origin, age, sex... and of course, I love to have fun as much as possible doing whatever I'm doing. 👯


## What am I doing now? 
I am currently looking for a job (do you want to hire me? 😉 ) and keep learning to improve my skills as a front-end developer. I'm open to suggestions, to collaborations and to talk about whatever you want...


## Tell me something! 💬 
Feel free to say hello and share something with me (a project :octocat:, a joke, a picture of your cat...)
