### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Amanda Palma, nice to meet you!
In my recent past I worked as a cultural manager but now I have become a super FRONT END DEVELOPER girl ;) 
I'm also musician and I love design.

I like psychology, plants, animals, nice people of any race, color, height, origin, age, sex... and of course, I love to have fun as much as possible doing whatever I'm doing. ðŸ‘¯

I am currently learning to improve my skills as a front-end developer and I'm open to suggestions, collaborations and to talk about whatever you want...

Feel free to say hello and share something with me (a project, a joke, a picture of your cat...ðŸ’¬ )
